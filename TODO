- cumulative results aggregation

- additional update sources:
 - Ubuntu : using Debian on ubuntu mirror should be OK, have to test
 - kdelook
 - pld
- alternative dependency input based on rpmcheck
- circular dependency input based on smart

youri-upload:
- svn support
- automatic bugzilla ticket closing on upload
- more customizable (template based ?) mail notification

library:
- API-based bugzilla interface, instead of SQL-based one
- more generic check-specific options handling in medias (don't use a
specific attribute for each of them)
